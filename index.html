            <div class="back">
                <p>This includes living in places not meant for habitation, staying in temporary shelters or funded motels, facing imminent loss of housing with no alternatives, or leaving institutions without a permanent place to go.

                <p>According to UN-Habitat, 1.6 billion people live in inadequate housing, with over 100 million entirely unhoused.

                <p>According to the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty, the 2.5–3.5 million figure comes from HUD’s narrow definition of homelessness, which counts only people in shelters, transitional housing, or public spaces not meant for living. This means it excludes millions more—such as those doubled-up with family or friends due to economic hardship—so the actual number of homeless Americans is likely much higher.</p>

            <div class="back">
                <p>When incomes can’t keep pace with soaring rent and living costs, maintaining stable housing becomes out of reach. Combined with a severe shortage of affordable homes, this drives many individuals and families into homelessness, even when they are employed or receiving financial assistance.</p>

                <p>More than half of people in shelters and about 4 in 10 living outside had jobs in the same year they were counted as homeless. The problem isn’t that they don’t work—it’s that jobs often don’t pay enough to cover rent and basic needs. You can be working hard and still not have a place to live.</p>

But even with that help, it’s not enough to get them back into stable housing. The safety net helps people survive, but it rarely helps them escape homelessness.</p>

                <p>Every year, over 50,000 people go straight from jail or prison into homeless shelters. Many others end up sleeping outside or in unstable situations before finding a safe place to stay. Being homeless right after incarceration makes it harder to find work, stay healthy, and avoid reoffending.

                <p>When someone is homeless for a long time and struggles with serious mental health issues, frequent hospital visits, emergency care, and other costly services can add up to about $40,000 each year—often covered by taxpayers.

Over the course of a year, this led to about $777 in savings per person for the community through reduced shelter stays and lower service use. Recipients used most of the money on rent, groceries, transportation, and other essentials that supported their stability. Very little was spent on alcohol, drugs, or cigarettes, directly challenging one of the most common—and harmful—stereotypes about people experiencing homelessness.</p>

                <p>The vast majority of people experiencing homelessness say they would move indoors if safe, stable, and affordable housing were offered. Many avoid shelters not out of “service resistance” but because they are unsafe, overcrowded, or fail to meet personal needs. The false belief that people choose homelessness out of laziness ignores systemic barriers and leads to policies that blame individuals instead of addressing root causes like housing shortages and poverty.</p>

                <p>Research shows up to 49 percent of people experiencing homelessness have been victims of violent crime, a rate many times higher than in the general population. They face elevated risks of assault, theft, and harassment simply because they live without secure shelter. Despite this, public perception often wrongly paints them as dangerous, even though studies find they are less likely to commit violent crimes than housed individuals.</p>

Barriers in housing, jobs, education, wages, healthcare, and the justice system strip away opportunities and make escaping poverty harder.

This shows that single adult men represent the largest portion of the individual homeless population, facing unique challenges that differ from those of homeless families.</p>

                <p>Homeless Americans are left out of poverty statistics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="back">
                <p>Despite facing some of the most severe deprivation in the country, people experiencing homelessness are not fully counted in official poverty data or extreme poverty research. They’re also largely excluded from national household surveys, making their struggles less visible in policy discussions. As a result, understanding their economic reality often relies on limited, outdated, or self-reported studies, leaving big gaps in the picture of poverty in America.</p>

                <p>Sheltered homeless get more help than those outside.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="back">
                <p>People in shelters usually get more benefits than people sleeping outside. A big reason is that families—who are more likely to be in shelters—often qualify for more programs than single adults. That leaves many living on the streets with less support, even though their needs can be just as urgent, if not greater.</p>
